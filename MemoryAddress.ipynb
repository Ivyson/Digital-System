    "    - This makes up 15 bits.\n",

    "    - These ICs will always be selected as long as $A_{\\text{14}} = 0$.\n",
    "    - This implies that from having bits [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] to having [0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1], IC3 and IC4 will be selected.\n",
    "    - Convert the above binaries into hexadecimal values, it should give you: 0000H to 3FFFH.\n",
    "    - Immediately when $A_{\\text{14}} = 1$, Chip 1 and Chip 2 are selected, disabling th IC3 AND IC4. The initial condition is when [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0].\n",
    "    - This will happen up until we reach the maximum output of the data input which is [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1].\n",
    "    - Now just convert the above binaries into hexadecimal: giving you 4000H to 7FFFH."
